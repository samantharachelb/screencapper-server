# Contributor Code of Conduct

## The Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making 
participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, 
disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, 
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Standards

### Examples of good behaviour:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing view points and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.

### Examples of bad behaviour:

- Using dehumanizing language
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Use of sexually charged language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without that user's explicit permission.

## Our responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards or acceptable behaviour and are expected to take 
appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, 
issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any
contributor for behaviours deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the 
project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail 
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline 
event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting the [project's owner](project-owner) 
The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the 
circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. 
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

## TL;DR
- This Code of Conduct applies to both this repository and related repositories.
- Don't be an asshole. If you act like an asshole, then you become fair game and forfeit the right to complain when 
you're treated the same way.
- Zero-tolerance of sexual harassment. I'm not fucking around.
- If you see something hinky, contact a project maintainer.
